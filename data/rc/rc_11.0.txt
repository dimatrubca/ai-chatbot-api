Why should I take this module?
Welcome to IPv4 Addressing!
Currently, there are still plenty of networks using IPv4 addressing, even as the organizations which use them are making the transition to IPv6. So it is still very important for network administrators to know everything they can about IPv4 addressing. This module covers the fundamental aspects of IPv4 addressing in detail. It includes how to segment a network into subnets and how to create a variable-length subnet mask (VLSM) as part of an overall IPv4 addressing scheme. Subnetting is like cutting a pie into smaller and smaller pieces. Subnetting may seem overwhelming at first, but we show you some tricks to help you along the way. This module includes several videos, activities to help you practice subnetting, Packet Tracers and a lab. Once you get the hang of it, youâ€™ll be on your way to network administration!
