Why should I take this module?
Welcome to Physical Layer!
The physical layer of the OSI model sits at the bottom of the stack. It is part of the Network Access layer of the TCP/IP model. Without the physical layer, you would not have a network. This module explains, in detail, the three ways to connect to the physical layer. Packet Tracer activities and labs will give you the confidence you need to cable up your own network! Letâ€™s get busy!
