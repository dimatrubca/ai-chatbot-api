Why should I take this module?
Welcome to IPv6 Addressing!
It is a great time to be (or become) a network administrator! Why? Because in many networks, you will find both IPv4 and IPv6 working together. After the hard work of learning to subnet an IPv4 network, you may find that subnetting an IPv6 network is much easier. You probably didnâ€™t expect that, did you? A Packet Tracer at the end of this module will give you the opportunity to subnet an IPv6 network. Go ahead, jump in!
