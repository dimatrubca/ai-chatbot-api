Why should I take this module?
Welcome to Basic Switch and End Device Configuration!
As part of your career in networking, you might have to set up a new network or maintain and upgrade an existing one. In either case, you’ll configure switches and end devices so that they are secure and perform effectively based on your requirements.
Out of the box, switches and end devices come with some general configuration. But for your particular network, switches and end devices require your specific information and instructions. In this module, you will learn how to access Cisco IOS network devices. You will learn basic configuration commands and use them to configure and verify a Cisco IOS device and an end device with an IP address.
Of course, there is much more to network administration, but none of that can happen without first configuring switches and end devices. Let’s get started!
