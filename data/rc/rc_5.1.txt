Binary and IPv4 Addresses
IPv4 addresses begin as binary, a series of only 1s and 0s. These are difficult to manage, so network administrators must convert them to decimal. This topic shows you a few ways to do this.
Binary is a numbering system that consists of the digits 0 and 1 called bits. In contrast, the decimal numbering system consists of 10 digits consisting of the digits 0 – 9.
Binary is important for us to understand because hosts, servers, and network devices use binary addressing. Specifically, they use binary IPv4 addresses, as shown in the figure, to identify each other.

Each address consists of a string of 32 bits, divided into four sections called octets. Each octet contains 8 bits (or 1 byte) separated with a dot. For example, PC1 in the figure is assigned IPv4 address 11000000.10101000.00001010.00001010. Its default gateway address would be that of R1 Gigabit Ethernet interface 11000000.10101000.00001010.00000001.
Binary works well with hosts and network devices. However, it is very challenging for humans to work with.
For ease of use by people, IPv4 addresses are commonly expressed in dotted decimal notation. PC1 is assigned the IPv4 address 192.168.10.10, and its default gateway address is 192.168.10.1, as shown in the figure.

For a solid understanding of network addressing, it is necessary to know binary addressing and gain practical skills converting between binary and dotted decimal IPv4 addresses. This section will cover how to convert between base two (binary) and base 10 (decimal) numbering systems.

Binary Positional Notation
Learning to convert binary to decimal requires an understanding of positional notation. Positional notation means that a digit represents different values depending on the “position” the digit occupies in the sequence of numbers. You already know the most common numbering system, the decimal (base 10) notation system.
The decimal positional notation system operates as described in the table.

Position in Number 3 2 1 0
Calculate (103) (102) (101) (100)
Position value 1000 100 10 1
The following bullets describe each row of the table.
Row 1, Radix is the number base. Decimal notation is based on 10, therefore the radix is 10.
Row 2, Position in number considers the position of the decimal number starting with, from right to left, 0 (1st position), 1 (2nd position), 2 (3rd position), 3 (4th position). These numbers also represent the exponential value use to calculate the positional value in the 4th row.
Row 3 calculates the positional value by taking the radix and raising it by the exponential value of its position in row 2.
Note: n0 is = 1.
Row 4 positional value represents units of thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.
To use the positional system, match a given number to its positional value. The example in the table illustrates how positional notation is used with the decimal number 1234.

The following bullets describe each row of the table.
Row 1, Radix is the number base. Binary notation is based on 2, therefore the radix is 2.
Row 2, Position in number considers the position of the binary number starting with, from right to left, 0 (1st position), 1 (2nd position), 2 (3rd position), 3 (4th position). These numbers also represent the exponential value use to calculate the positional value in the 4th row.
Row 3 calculates the positional value by taking the radix and raising it by the exponential value of its position in row 2.
Note: n0 is = 1.
Row 4 positional value represents units of ones, twos, fours, eights, etc.
The example in the table illustrates how a binary number 11000000 corresponds to the number 192. If the binary number had been 10101000, then the corresponding decimal number would be 168.

Convert Binary to Decimal
To convert a binary IPv4 address to its dotted decimal equivalent, divide the IPv4 address into four 8-bit octets. Next apply the binary positional value to the first octet binary number and calculate accordingly.
For example, consider that 11000000.10101000.00001011.00001010 is the binary IPv4 address of a host. To convert the binary address to decimal, start with the first octet, as shown in the table. Enter the 8-bit binary number under the positional value of row 1 and then calculate to produce the decimal number 192. This number goes into the first octet of the dotted decimal notation.

Is the decimal number of the octet (n) equal to or greater than the most-significant bit (128)?
If no, then enter binary 0 in the 128 positional value.
If yes, then add a binary 1 in the 128 positional value and subtract 128 from the decimal number.

Decimal to Binary Conversion Example
To help understand the process, consider the IP address 192.168.11.10.
The first octet number 192 is converted to binary using the previously explained positional notation process.
It is possible to bypass the process of subtraction with easier or smaller decimal numbers. For instance, notice that it is fairly easy to calculate the third octet converted to a binary number without actually going through the subtraction process (8 + 2 = 10). The binary value of the third octet is 00001010.
The fourth octet is 11 (8 + 2 + 1). The binary value of the fourth octet is 00001011.
Converting between binary and decimal may seem challenging at first, but with practice it should become easier over time.
